## üõ† Password Attack

- Uses a list of passwords from the file:  
  \`passkey.txt\`

- Attempts login through Instagram's endpoint:
  \`https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/ajax/\`

- For each **password**, the script:
  - Sends an **authenticated POST request**
  - Waits for the response
  - If successful, it **saves the credentials**
  - If not, it continues to the next password

- Displays real-time feedback with:
  - `Trying password: ...`
  - `Login successful` or `Not correct password`

- After a successful login:
  - Account data is saved to:
    - \`<username>.txt\`
    - \`<username>.json\`
  - Additional account analysis is shown in a table

## üìÅ Output Files

- `TXT File`: Contains basic credentials and bio  
- `JSON File`: Structured data for further use  
- Example file names:  
  - \`targetuser.txt\`  
  - \`targetuser.json\`

## ‚è± Notes

- You can **cancel** the process anytime with `Ctrl + C`
- If no correct password is found, the script will notify:
  > `All passwords tested. No successful login!`
